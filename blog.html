            <p>This blog was created in hopes of assimilating and empowering people of color. With majority of the social media outlets being white-owned, it's almost next to impossible to post facts about issues within the minority community without posts
                being removed.<br> The topics of conversation will not only be limited to issues that plague the community, but also the promotion of businesses owned minorities, pick me ups for when you're having a rough day, education, and simply a
                place to vent. <br> This blog will allow everyone from all walks of life to contribute. However, this will not be a sanctuary for hate, but it will embody solutions, and hopefully become a voice for those who have always been asked to
                remain silent. There are no limits to the topics of conversation. This platform is being constructed to become a melting pot of solutions. We are the majority, and when we can come together in one place with the same end result, we are
                unstoppable. </p>
